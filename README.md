# 👖 Pattern Visualizer

A web-based tool that lets fashion designers (starting with me, building my clothing brand SEVR) upload fabric patterns and preview them on 3D garments.

## 🚀 Why I’m Building This

I’m starting a clothing brand, and one of the hardest parts of working with manufacturers is visualizing how a fabric pattern will actually look on a finished garment.

Instead of sending 2D swatches back and forth, this project lets me:

Upload a pattern (cheetah print, tropical print, etc.)

Apply it to a garment model (pants for now)

Adjust scaling/repeating

Share previews with manufacturers or collaborators

It’s also a way to combine my tech background with my passion for fashion and design.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

3D Rendering: Three.js + React Three Fiber + Drei

Planned Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (for auth, file storage, and user libraries)
